# OfficeGraph

OfficeGraph is a large, real world knowledge graph containing measurements taken by 444 IoT devices, over 11 months, in a seven story office building. The devices are made up of 17 different sensor models, which make measurements of many different properties.

This is a zipped version of OfficeGraph. Instead of one file containing the entire knowledge graph the zipped folders contains a separate file for each individual device. Each file contains all the measurements made by the device.
The enrichments are included in separate files.

The resource paper describing this dataset is currently under submission.
